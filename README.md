### Hello Friends! 👋
This is my Github page! It's pretty cool.

### 🚀 About Me

My name is FusionIQ, and I am a 15 year old aspiring creator eager to showcase my passions for creating things. Although I am still in the learning phase, I am committed to honing my skills and becoming proficient in a variety of areas. ***All of my projects will be here to view and download for free!*** I'm always excited to share my work with others and to see what people think of my creations.


### My Current Projects:
⚔️ **Mythical Realms MMORPG** 
Mythical Realms a Minecraft Java Edition server running on version *1.19.3* which tries to break the barrier of minecraft's game engine. It has always been a dream of mine to run a succesful Minecraft MMORPG server, and I constantly update and work on it. I am hoping to fully release it by **2025** due to how many amazing features that will implemented on the server. Currently it is a solo project, but I might expand and hire some developers to make the process faster.

🤺 **An RPG Unity Game**
I am currently learning how to code in C#, so I can make my dream RPG game in Unity! I don't have a name yet, but I have some very awesome ideas on how the game's core mechanics work and some cool monsters and bosses.


🧪 **The Lab**. The lab is a special place which holds a bunch of random, yet creative projects that I make. They can be real life projects such as science experiements or attempts to code crazy ideas that you give me. The Lab is just a place where I have fun and express myself.

> More information on The Lab below:

### The Lab 🧪
In The Lab, you'll find a diverse range of projects, from random code to visually stunning 3D models and carefully edited videos. I believe that creativity should be accessible to everyone, which is why all of my projects are available to view and download for free. Whether you're a fellow Minecraft enthusiast, a budding artist, or just someone looking to explore new forms of creative expression, I hope that you find something here that sparks your interest and inspires you to make something amazing.

**Lab Projects:**

🚤 Creating a solar powered boat with my school's robotics team

🤖 Jailbreaking different chat bot AIs *(very fun)

🧨 Exploding a bunch of potatoes with C4 explosives

🚙 Mounting a turret on top of an RC car

⭐️ And much more!

**I will be doing these projects with my friends and family, and you can view the videos on my YouTube channel!**
